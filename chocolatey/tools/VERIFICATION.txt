VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.
 
I'm the author of the software, but if further verification is necessary you can create a SHA256 checksum of the binary file in this package. It should match the ones in https://github.com/philippgille/serve/releases.

For example, when this NuGet package is version 0.3.0, you can create a SHA256 checksum of serve.exe and check if it matches https://github.com/philippgille/serve/releases/download/v0.3.0/serve_v0.3.0_Windows_x64.exe.sha256.
