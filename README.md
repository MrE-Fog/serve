`serve` starts a simple temporary static file server in your current directory and prints your IP address to share with colleagues.

It was based on [a Gist](https://gist.github.com/paulmach/7271283/2a1116ca15e34ee23ac5a3a87e2a626451424993) by [Paul Mach](https://github.com/paulmach), but has evolved a lot.

Features
--------

- [X] Serves static files in any given accessible directory until you hit `Ctrl-C`
- [X] Prints a table of your network interfaces and their IP addresses and guesses which one you most likely want to share
- [X] Follows softlinks transparently
- [X] Optional basic authentication
- [X] Optionally serve files via HTTPS instead of HTTP, using a temporary self signed certificate that's automatically generated for you on the fly
- [X] Optionally bind to a specific network interface, for example `localhost` to disable access from other devices
- [X] Only uses the Go standard library and no external dependencies
- [X] Single file executable, usable without any installation, or easy automatic updates when using a package manager

### Roadmap

- Find out and print external IP address that's reachable from the Internet
- Optionally compress files when requested
- Optionally make your server reachable from the Internet even if it's behind a router with NAT
  - Via reverse SSH tunnel
  - Via 3rd party service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), [https://localtunnel.me](https://localtunnel.me), [LabStack Tunnel](https://labstack.com/docs/tunnel) etc.
  - Via [frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp)
- Optionally run a [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) hidden service (v3) for:
  - Automatic accessibility from the Internet (via Tor Browser or proxy) even when behind a router with NAT
  - Encrypted traffic
  - No exposure of your IP address

Install
-------

We recommend installing `serve` with one of the following package managers, because they provide you with functionality such as automatic updates, instant availability as command in the `PATH`, easy removal, sandboxing (depending on the package manager) etc.  
But alternatively you can always install `serve` manually as well, see [Manually](#manually).

### Windows

The easiest way is to use the package manager [Scoop](http://scoop.sh/):  
`scoop install serve`

Another option is [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):  
`choco install serve`

You can also have a look at the description in the Chocolatey Gallery on [https://chocolatey.org/packages/serve/](https://chocolatey.org/packages/serve/).

### macOS

The easiest way is to use the package manager [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):  
`brew tap philippgille/tap`  
`brew install serve`

Or in a single command:  
`brew install philippgille/tap/serve`

### Linux

The easiest way is to use the package manager [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/), which is installed by default on Ubuntu 16.04 and later:  
`snap install serve`

You can also have a look at the description in the Snap Store on [https://snapcraft.io/serve](https://snapcraft.io/serve).

> Note: Due to sandboxing by Snap, `serve` can only serve files in the user's `$HOME` directory.

### Manually

#### With Go installed

`go get -u github.com/philippgille/serve`

> Note: Requires your `$GOPATH/bin` directory to be in your `PATH`, which is usually the case.

#### Without Go installed

You can download the binary for your OS from the [releases](https://github.com/philippgille/serve/releases) simply make it available as command in your `PATH`. See [Manual Installation](https://github.com/philippgille/serve/tree/master/docs#manual-installation) for details.

Docker
------

`serve` is also available as Docker image in the Docker Hub: [https://hub.docker.com/r/philippgille/serve/](https://hub.docker.com/r/philippgille/serve/)

Please read [docker/README.md](https://github.com/philippgille/serve/blob/master/docker/README.md) for information on how to use it.

Use
---

```
$ serve -h
Usage of serve:
  -a string
        Require basic authentication with the given credentials (e.g. -a "alice:secret")
  -b string
        Bind to (listen on) a specific interface. "0.0.0.0" is for ALL interfaces. "localhost" disables access from other devices. (default "0.0.0.0")
  -d string
        The directory of static files to host (default ".")
  -h    Print the usage
  -p string
        Port to serve on. 8080 by default for HTTP, 8443 for HTTPS (when using the -s flag) (default "8080")
  -s    Serve via HTTPS instead of HTTP. Creates a temporary self-signed certificate for localhost, 127.0.0.1, <hostname>.local, <hostname>.lan, <hostname>.home and the determined LAN IP address
  -t    Test / dry run (just prints the interface table)
  -v    Print the version
```

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the server.

### Example

```bash
~/path/to/servable/files$ serve

Serving "." on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) on HTTP port: 8080

Local network interfaces and their IP address so you can pass one to your colleagues:

      Interface      |  IPv4 Address   |              IPv6 Address
---------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------
lo                   | 127.0.0.1       | ::1
eth0                 |                 | 
wlan0                | 192.168.178.123 | fe80::e7b:fdaf:ae5d:3cfa
virbr0               | 192.168.122.1   | 
br-8ef347e8a4e9      | 172.22.0.1      | fe80::42:c9ff:fed3:35a
docker_gwbridge      | 172.21.0.1      | 
docker0              | 172.17.0.1      | fe80::42:c6cf:fe3d:a554
veth0d522f4          |                 | fe80::307a:7fcf:fe3d:cba4

You probably want to share:
http://192.168.178.123:8080
```

When opening the URL `http://192.168.178.123:8080` in a browser you see the directory you're serving. For example:

Build
-----

To build `serve` by yourself:

1. [Install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. `cd` into the root directory of this repository
3. Execute: `go build`

> Note: The binaries in GitHub Releases are shrinked with additional Go linker flags and UPX

To also make `serve` available as command in other directories:

1. Add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `PATH` if you haven't done that already when installing Go
2. Execute: `go install`

There are also build scripts for Windows and Linux for creating release artifacts (shrinked binaries for Windows, macOS and Linux):

- Windows: `build/build.ps1`
- Linux: `build/build.sh`

> Note: They require Go and UPX to be installed

To build with a Docker container:

`docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/go/src/github.com/philippgille/serve -w /go/src/github.com/philippgille/serve golang build/build.sh noupx`  
Or with UPX:  
`docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/go/src/github.com/philippgille/serve -w /go/src/github.com/philippgille/serve golang bash -c "apt update && apt install -y upx-ucl && build/build.sh"`

> Note: You have to use `${pwd}` instead of `$(pwd)` on Windows.

### Packages

For Scoop and Homebrew no packages need to be built. They use "manifests"/"formulae" and the binaries from GitHub Releases.

For releasing a new version, they need to be updated here:

- Scoop: [https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/blob/master/bucket/serve.json](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/blob/master/bucket/serve.json)
- Homebrew: [https://github.com/philippgille/homebrew-tap/blob/master/serve.rb](https://github.com/philippgille/homebrew-tap/blob/master/serve.rb)

For Snap a Git hook is set up in the Snapcraft dashboard to automatically build a new Snap on every commit, so for releasing a new version the file in *this* repository needs to be updated:

- Snap: [https://github.com/philippgille/serve/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/philippgille/serve/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml)

The Snap package can also be built manually. In the past this could even be done within a Docker container, but the [official Snapcraft Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/u/snapcoret/snapcraft) (according to the [docs](https://docs.snapcraft.io/build-on-docker/4158)) is outdated (as of 2019-05-01) and doesn't contain the latest version of `snapcraft` (and installing the latest version via `snap` itself, as you'd do nowadays according to the official docs, doesn't work).  
So now you can only build the Snap package on Linux, using the following steps:

1. `snap install snapcraft --classic`
2. `snapcraft`

Depending on the current `serve` version and your CPU's architecture it will create a file like `serve_0.3.0_amd64.snap`, which can manually be installed with `snap install --dangerous serve_0.3.0_amd64.snap`.

The Chocolatey packages need to be uploaded manually to Chocolatey [here](https://chocolatey.org/packages/upload). The package can be built with this script:

- Windows: `build\build-chocolatey.ps1`

The Docker image can be built like this:

`docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t philippgille/serve .`
